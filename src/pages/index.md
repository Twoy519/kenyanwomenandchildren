  # Our Mission


  Our California-based registered NGO 501 (c) was developed in January 2015. Our ongoing mission is:


  * To implement ongoing wildlife conservation education programs for Maasai children and adults.

  * To address the importance of education in the fields of anti-poaching and human wildlife conflict.

  * To develop ongoing programs for addressing the needs of our local community in the Masai Mara region.

  * To create jobs for our local communities, significantly contributing towards alleviating poverty.

  * And to offer an authentic, educational experience to join our wildlife conservation safari tours –– or for volunteers with onsite housing and meals.
